<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tushar Phugat, and I am delighted to welcome you to my personal website. (this is just a fun Project)

<h2>Background</h2>

I am a BBA graduate with a passion for technology and an insatiable curiosity for the world of web development. Currently, I am working as a Program Executive at Monster.com, where I have honed my organizational and communication skills. However, my true passion lies in the realm of coding and software development.

<h2>Journey to Full Stack Development</h2>

My journey into the world of Full Stack Development started as a personal interest and has quickly evolved into a dedicated pursuit. In my free time, I immerse myself in the wonders of coding, web development, and programming languages. I find joy in the process of building functional and visually appealing websites and web applications from scratch.
