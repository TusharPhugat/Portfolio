<h1>Special Notice</h1>
<h2>Hello Manik</h2>
<p>I want to tell you something really significant, so please read this carefully. Remember when we were battling Nazis in Japan? At the time, I scored 2 kgs of cannabis and buried it in the mountain behind the school in Tokyo.<br/>
    So I'd like you to travel to Japan and digg there. That cannabis was no ordinary weed; many people all around the world were looking for it. This task will also cost you your life, so please prepare accordingly.</p>
<p>i am attaching the map and the list of things you should carry</p>
